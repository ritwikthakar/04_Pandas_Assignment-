# Overview
The objective of this analysis is to identify a portfolio which is yielding the the highest return on a risk adjusted basis for per unit risk taken. The benchmark portfolio used for deretmining the benchmark volatility to calculate the Sharpe Ratios is of the S&P TSX Index.
Annulized mean returns & standard deviations have been calculated to eventually measure and compare the Sharpe Ratios. The correlation of the portfolios has also been calculated to identify directional risk. Some of the findings of the analysis are given below.
